# Using QtYeti

## Order Tracing
• Start by loading a suitable flatfield FITS file via the button `Load Flatfield File`.  
• After loading, you can now let the program find orders in the flatfile image for you by clicking with the `right mouse button` into the image.  
• Now, green boxes will appear indicating the different orders. You can repeat this process over and over again until suffiently many orders are found.  
• Open the Tracer Window by clicking on `Open Tracer Window`. Here you can find settings called `Peak Distance`, `Peak Height`, `Peak Prominence` and `Peak Width`.  
• These parameters help to set the sensitivity of the automatic peak intensity function.
