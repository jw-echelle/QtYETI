### Disclaimer
This program is in its beginning stages. It is possible to fit and extract 1D spectra from 2D spectrograms.  
A spectral calibration is under development.  
Everything has been tested in a native python environment. Currently we have no experience using `conda` environments.

## Before you start
python[.exe] -m pip install --upgrade pip  
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Requirements
astropy>=6.0.0

see also `requirements.txt`

### Start QtYETI
• Navigate to the directory where QtYETI has been extracted to  
• Use "python ./QtYeti.py"  

### Features
In the `Calibration` Tab you can find a geometric calibrator that has been used to sucessfully predict ThAr lines in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00105">our manuscript</a>.
